* use the near-jsonrpc-client crate instead of handcoding that stuff.
  It will be easier to use once a version containing
  https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/commit/471a53be062e0880c6bc5c2721d123da2a9e0c2e
  is published

* use sqlx instead of diesel-rs for database operations. Right now there's
  a tradeoff between simplicity and this gitub issue: https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/294
  since we insert multiple records at once into the validator stats table
